For the past 14 years at MANIT Bhopal, Dr. Munoth has dedicated himself to teaching and fostering interdisciplinary research.

In addition to his academic and research roles, Dr. Munoth serves as the Honorary Director of the [Council of Architecture’s Training and Research Centre (COA-TRC)](https://www.coa.gov.in/council_of_architecture_trc.php) at MANIT Bhopal. This centre aims to enhance entrepreneurship and skill development among students, academics, and professionals, aligning with national initiatives.

Dr. Munoth's commitment to excellence is reflected in numerous academic honours and awards for both teaching and research.
